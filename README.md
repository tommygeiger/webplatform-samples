# [Web Speech API Demos](http://tommygeiger.com/webspeech)

A series of demos using the Google web speech API forked from [this repo](https://github.com/googlearchive/webplatform-samples).
  
  1. [Speaking Rate Detection and Feeback](http://tommygeiger.com/webspeech/wpm): a realtime words-per-minute tracker with feedback
  2. [Automated Agent](http://tommygeiger.com/webspeech/agent): a mock-up automated customer service agent
  3. [OK Google](http://tommygeiger.com/webspeech/ok): voice controlled Google search

Known Bugs:
  The Speaking Rate Detection return incorrect values if the "interim transcript" is revised and contains fewer words than before.
